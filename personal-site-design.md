Who is your target audience?

    Me! The site is primarly for myself, it's a practice instrument. Secondarily, it is for EDA staff to check my progress and any of my fellow students to check out what I've done.

How do you want your site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

    Information needs to be concise and well laid out. The site needs to work at whichever device it is viewed at. 

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

    Have a clear navigation bar that shows the user the available options. Create landingpages where necessary, for example for the blogs. Use media queries to make he site responsive for different break points.
